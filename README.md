# Alphabet Soup Charity

## Overview of Analysis
This project is designed to analyze the success for organizations recieving funding from the charity organization Alphabet soup.  There were a variety of categories of data and we were able to format the data so that the success outcomes could be measures and future outcomes could be predicted.  We were able to classify categories such as industry affiliattion, government organization classification,active statusm income classification, and if money was used successfully.  Though this data was not all numerical we were able to preprocess the data so it could effectively be evaluated and a model designed to train and predict outcomes.

## Results

## Data Preprocessing
Target Variables: Is Sucessful
Feature variables:application type, classification
Variables removed from data: EIN, NAME



## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model? Initially 2 layers, 90 nuerons, and 2 activation functions
Were you able to achieve the target model performance? I was unable to create a performance rate over 75%
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance? I increased to 3 then 4 hidden layers, I changed out the activation types, increased the neurons, and updated from 100 ephochs to 200 epochs.

## Summary
Overall, my result were less than I hoped for my model with about a 73% accuracy rate.  Thought the results could have been much better, I think I was building towards a good model.  My model was likely over fit and eliminating some columns may have been benificial to move forward.
